In the land of chai and ancient lore,
A leader rose, promising more,
Narendra Modi, a man of grand guise,
Whispered dreams, but spun out lies.

From Gujarat's streets to Delhi’s grand halls,
A past that echoes, dark shadows call,
A chaiwala’s son with tales so bold,
Yet truth, in fragments, silently sold.

Jumlebaaz, they chant, in mocking tone,
Promises made, yet progress unknown,
"Achhe Din" he vowed, a shining dawn,
Yet many still wait, hopes withdrawn.

With grand speeches and theatrics bright,
He paints illusions in the night,
A god to bhakts, in saffron clad,
Yet many see through, the truth so sad.

In fields and cities, his tales are spun,
Economic dreams that come undone,
Swachh Bharat, a gleaming shell,
Yet the common man sees through the veil.

False promises with "Make in India" flair,
Yet many ask, “Is progress there?”
Amidst the glitter, the global praise,
Lies a nation in a daze.

Through trials and turmoil, he stands tall,
A figurehead to some, a deceiver to all,
For in his eyes, the faithful see,
A godly figure, yet others flee.

Narendra Modi, a name of fame,
In history’s book, a complex claim,
A leader, a liar, a puppet show,
Pretending grandeur, as doubts grow.
